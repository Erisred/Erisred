# Terms and legal page

This is a work of fiction, devised solely from my own mind. Any resemblance to actual works is purely coincidental, and any instructions given should not be taken as factual, nor followed. They are to be interpreted as the opinion of the author only.

Everything is released to the public as free and open source, although the author would appreciate being let known when his works are used, cited, or referenced elsewhere.

Eventually there will be something much more binding here, but until then this will have to do.
