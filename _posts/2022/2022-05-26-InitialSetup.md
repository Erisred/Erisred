I have to start somewhere, so here goes...

# A start

### My journey, in brief
- OMG, I can do _what_ on a web browser? Using [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) as a guide, I tinkered for a while, but soon realized I needed some hand-on learning.
- Enter [thenewboston](https://thenewboston.com/), back before it embraced the blockchain (?) - when Bucky worried about web design and bacon. I watched and participated in almost all of the tutorials there. I still have most of the homework on an old drive - somewhere. I loved this site, and the way everything was **fun**.
- Sometime later I discovered [Tiddlywiki](https://tiddlywiki.com/), and it started some real thoughts about creating something lasting. I definitely wanted a wiki, but also started a journaling habit I continue even now, albeit in a different form.
- I stumbled on [X10 Hosting](https://x10hosting.com/), which has a really good free tier with a full working cPanel and apps. I still use this for some of my hosting needs.
- Using X10, I installed an instance of [DokuWiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki) that I kept going for a long time before updates broke some things I wasn’t interested in fixing.
- I then bounced between DokuWiki, TiddlyWiki, and a static site for a little bit.
- Enter Git and Github. Another shiny way to host a site. Of course, that meant learning Jekyll, which was foreign to me at the time. Still is, TBH, but I now know enough to get by.
- Oh, boy. Now comes PKM. OneNote, Evernote, Google Keep, Trello, Zenkit, Joplin and a host of others. I got on the Roam train, but not for long. There was too much to it, and nothing seemed intuitive. This of course led to plaintext, markdown, dendron, foam - and my current resting point, [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
- I’ve stuck with Obsidian longer than anything else - over 2 years, now. I love the openness of it, but also the plaintext/markdown boundaries that keep me grounded. My saving grace was when I decided to delete my own theme, and stick to a couple of community ones. I then took an oath to keep my snippets very minimal so I don’t feel the need to customize. It’s about content, dammit.

### That's great, so why the soliloquy?
So, it turns out I can do a lot with the internet now. I have a decent note-taking system, and am learning al the time. I like having all my "stuff" available to me everywhere. However, I don't want all of that to be public. I have a journal, some personal data, and all kinds of stuff smattered throughout. Also, I'm cheap and like to tinker.

So now to the *what went wrong* part. I set up a site, and tweak everything - base pages, tags, collections, styling, *everything*. By the time everything is how I want it, it's a little less shiny, or something broke along the way (usually self-induced). I need something simpler that mostly works out of the box and allows for simple content hosting. Less variables = less problems.

I also never published from my PKM, because of the indecision. What is this? Do I need it in multiple places? I kept trying to define things, but never really settled.

### What I'll do this time
No guarantees it'll work, but here goes...

I made a simple framework/template using a basic Jekyll setup. In fact, I just followed the [step-by-step](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/) tutorial from Jekyll as a starting point. Then, since I like how minimal it is, I incorporated a slightly modified version of the [MVP.css](https://andybrewer.github.io/mvp/) style. No frills, no fancy stuff, and it works fairly well. I indulged long enough just to get a dark/light theme switcher going. Everything else is going to be developed as-needed, not as-I-think-of-it.

Also, I'll define things better, and set some intentions.

### Intentions
I believe I need to set expectations and definitions at the start.
What goes where?
- My PKM will continue to house personal details: product manuals, house plans, projects, journals. Drafts and most content will almost always *start in the PKM, until ready to be published*.
- How-to things that I might need on the run, or may benefit others: winterize my boat, service the lawn mower.

### Conclusion
Here is a first post to break the ice and set some ground rules. Let's see what happens.
